## Live Demo
- comming soon, I hope!

## What's the purpose of this?
- I simply love the process of creating characters for campaigns, even I don't end up using them right away!
- I want to practice my tech stack while working on a topic I truly enjoy
- Maybe it'll even help a guildmate or two!

## Tech Stack (subject to change)
- React.js
- TailwindCSS
- Zustand
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Vercel

## Suggestions?
Got any ideas or feedback? I'd love to hear them!
